# Presentation Control using hand gestures and voice commands


## Description
The project involves controlling presentations using hand gestures and voice commands, providing an innovative and accessible way to navigate slides during presentations. A webcam captures hand movements, and computer vision techniques are used to recognize gestures like swiping left for the next slide. Voice commands, recognized by a speech recognition engine, allow for actions like moving between slides or starting the presentation.
